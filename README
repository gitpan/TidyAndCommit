NAME
    TidyAnyCommit - This class can be used as a wrapper around a commit
    (check example for how to wrap this around a subversion commit message).
    The module cleans up the target code using perltidy before running the
    next step(usually a svn commit statement for my own use case). Perltidy
    must be installed before use of this script. This Class will Tidy all
    files with .pm, .cgi or .pl extension when passed a file name and it
    will search for all file in a folder with .pm, .cgi or .pl extension
    when passed a foldername pass your own tidyrc config file to the object
    to get custom tidy goodness.

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use warnings;
      use TidyAndCommit;

      my $tncobj = TidyAndCommit->new(
                               perltidyrc => './xt/.perltidyrc',
                               runbefore  => 'svn commit' # The command to call on the list post commit
                                 );
      my @list; # List of files and folders to be tidied and committed
      push @list,'./'; 
      $tncobj->tnc(\@list); # \@list is a list of absolute or relative paths to files and folders.
                            #
                            # If you want to pass a list of files or folders to the script to tidy and
                            # then commit, you might simply use the @ARGV array instead of @list here. 
                            # Once you do that this script will essentially work as a wrapper around 
                            # the command "svn commit" passed as "runbefore" param above you can further 
                            # modify this script to support -m flags for commit messages etc. 
                            # if your SVN_EDITOR is not set.
